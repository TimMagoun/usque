	title = {An eﬃcient orientation ﬁlter for inertial and inertial/magnetic sensor arrays},
	abstract = {This report presents a novel orientation ﬁlter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The ﬁlter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The beneﬁts of the ﬁlter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each ﬁlter update, (2) eﬀective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters deﬁned by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the ﬁlter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; {\textless} 0.6◦ static RMS error, {\textless} 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

	abstract = {Over the last 20-30 years, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has become the algorithm of choice in numerous nonlinear estimation and machine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (e.g., learning the weights of a neural network). The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. [I] proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state-estimation. This was extended to parameterestimation by Wan and van der Menve [2, 31. The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity of O ( L {\textasciitilde} )f’or general state-space problems. When the EKF is applied to parameterestimation, the special form of the state-space equations allows for an (3(L2)implementation. This paper introduces the squareroot unscented Kalman jilter (SR-UKF) which is also U ( L 3 )for general state-estimation and U ( L 2 )for parameter estimation (note the original formulation of the UKF for parameter-estimation was U ( L 3 ) ) .In addition, the square-root forms have the added benefit of numerical stability and guaranteed positive semi-definiteness of the state covariances.},

	abstract = {An unscented Kalman filter for matrix Lie groups is proposed where the time propagation of the state is formulated on the Lie algebra. This is done with the kinematic differential equation of the logarithm, where the inverse of the right Jacobian is used. The sigma points can then be expressed as logarithms in vector form, and time propagation of the sigma points and the computation of the mean and the covariance can be done on the Lie algebra. The resulting formulation is to a large extent based on logarithms in vector form, and is therefore closer to the UKF for systems in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n\$. This gives an elegant and well-structured formulation which provides additional insight into the problem, and which is computationally efficient. The proposed method is in particular formulated and investigated on the matrix Lie group \$SE(3)\$. A discussion on right and left Jacobians is included, and a novel closed form solution for the inverse of the right Jacobian on \$SE(3)\$ is derived, which gives a compact representation involving fewer matrix operations. The proposed method is validated in simulations.},

	abstract = {A new spacecraft attitude estimation approach based on the Unscented Filter is derived. For nonlinear systems the Unscented Filter uses a carefully selected set of sample points to more accurately map the probability distribution than the linearization of the standard Extended Kalman Filter, leading to faster convergence from inaccurate initial conditions in attitude estimation problems. The ﬁlter formulation is based on standard attitude-vector measurements using a gyro-based model for attitude propagation. The global attitude parameterization is given by a quaternion, while a generalized three-dimensional attitude representation is used to deﬁne the local attitude error. A multiplicative quaternion-error approach is derived from the local attitude error, which guarantees that quaternion normalization is maintained in the ﬁlter. Simulation results indicate that the Unscented Filter is more robust than the Extended Kalman Filter under realistic initial attitude-error conditions.},

We gather all available UKF variants in the literature, present corrections to theoretical inconsistencies, and provide a tool for the construction of new UKF’s in a consistent way. This systematization is done, mainly, by revisiting the concepts of Sigma-Representation, Unscented Transformation (UT), Scaled Unscented Transformation (SUT), UKF, and Square-Root Unscented Kalman Filter (SRUKF). Inconsistencies are related to 1) matching the order of the transformed covariance and cross-covariance matrices of both the UT and the SUT; 2) multiple UKF deﬁnitions; 3) issue with some reduced sets of sigma points described in the literature; 4) the conservativeness of the SUT; 5) the scaling effect of the SUT on both its transformed covariance and cross-covariance matrices; and 6) possibly ill-conditioned results in SRUKF’s. With the proposed systematization, the symmetric sets of sigma points in the literature are formally justiﬁed, and we are able to provide new consistent variations for UKF’s, such as the Scaled SRUKF’s and the UKF’s composed by the minimum number of sigma points. Furthermore, our proposed SRUKF has improved computational properties when compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

The claimed advantages with UKF are that it propagates the ﬁrst two moments of the posterior distribution and that it does not require gradients of the system model. We point out several less known links between EKF and UKF in terms of two conceptually different implementations of the Kalman ﬁlter: the standard one based on the discrete Riccati equation, and one based on a formula on conditional expectations that does not involve an explicit Riccati equation. First, it is shown that the sigma point function evaluations can be used in the classical EKF rather than an explicitly linearized model. Second, a less cited version of the EKF based on a second-order Taylor expansion is shown to be quite closely related to UKF. The different algorithms and results are illustrated with examples inspired by core observation models in target tracking and sensor network applications.},

To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a robust adaptive UKF (RAUKF) to improve the accuracy and robustness of state estimation with uncertain noise covariance. More specifically, at each timestep, a standard UKF will be implemented first to obtain the state estimations using the new acquired measurement data. Then an online fault-detection mechanism is adopted to judge if it is necessary to update current noise covariance. If necessary, innovation-based method and residual-based method are used to calculate the estimations of current noise covariance of process and measurement, respectively. By utilizing a weighting factor, the filter will combine the last noise covariance matrices with the estimations as the new noise covariance matrices. Finally, the state estimations will be corrected according to the new noise covariance matrices and previous state estimations. Compared with the standard UKF and other adaptive UKF algorithms, RAUKF converges faster to the actual noise covariance and thus achieves a better performance in terms of robustness, accuracy, and computation for nonlinear estimation with uncertain noise covariance, which is demonstrated by the simulation results.},

	abstract = {This work proposes an improved unscented Kalman filter (UKF)-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm based on an adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) with a noise statistic estimator. The algorithm solves the issue that conventional UKF-SLAM algorithms have declining accuracy, with divergence occurring when the prior noise statistic is unknown and time-varying. The new SLAM algorithm performs an online estimation of the statistical parameters of unknown system noise by introducing a modified Sage-Husa noise statistic estimator. The algorithm also judges whether the filter is divergent and restrains potential filtering divergence using a covariance matching method. This approach reduces state estimation error, effectively improving navigation accuracy of the SLAM system. A line feature extraction is implemented through a Hough transform based on the ranging sonar model. Test results based on unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) sea trial data indicate that the proposed AUKF-SLAM algorithm is valid and feasible and provides better accuracy than the standard UKF-SLAM system.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses two key limitations of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) when applied to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem: the cubic, in the number of states, computational complexity, and the inconsistency of the state estimates. In particular, we introduce a new sampling strategy that minimizes the linearization error and whose computational complexity is constant (i.e., independent of the size of the state vector). As a result, the overall computational complexity of UKF-based SLAM becomes of the same order as that of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) when applied to SLAM. Furthermore, we investigate the observability properties of the linear-regression-based model employed by the UKF, and propose a new algorithm, termed the Observability-Constrained (OC)-UKF, that improves the consistency of the state estimates. The superior performance of the OC-UKF compared to the standard UKF and its robustness to large linearization errors are validated by extensive simulations.},

	abstract = {At the present day, growing interest is paid to the development of more reliable surveillance systems for maritime situational awareness (MSA). The purpose is to detect, track and classify cooperative and non-cooperative targets. For this reason, great interest is given to low-power/cost High-Frequency Surface-Wave (HFSW) radars as an early-warning tool for over-the-horizon (OTH) applications. However, in HFSW radars there is a trade-off in terms of quality and cost, i.e. the radar system exhibits poor azimuth resolution, high non-linearity, and significant false alarm rate. All these aspects reduce tracking performance if not properly addressed. In this context, the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proposed. The tracking algorithm behavior is investigated by a comparison between the tracks generated by two HFSW radars, with overlapped fields of view, and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. A discussion is provided about the possible effectiveness of HFSW radar fusion strategies. Preliminary results from a HFSW Radar experiment are reported and discussed.},

The challenges come from the low accuracy and noisy data of the MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) technology, which is the basis of modern, miniaturized inertial sensors. In this article, we describe a novel approach to obtain an estimation of the orientation in quaternion form from the observations of gravity and magnetic field. Our approach provides a quaternion estimation as the algebraic solution of a system from inertial/magnetic observations. We separate the problems of finding the “tilt” quaternion and the heading quaternion in two sub-parts of our system. This procedure is the key for avoiding the impact of the magnetic disturbances on the roll and pitch components of the orientation when the sensor is surrounded by unwanted magnetic flux. We demonstrate the validity of our method first analytically and then empirically using simulated data. We propose a novel complementary filter for MAVs that fuses together gyroscope data with accelerometer and magnetic field readings. The correction part of the filter is based on the method described above and works for both IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) sensors. We evaluate the effectiveness of the filter and show that it significantly outperforms other common methods, using publicly available datasets with ground-truth data recorded during a real flight experiment of a micro quadrotor helicopter.},

	abstract = {The problem of estimating from noisy measurement data the state of a dynamical system described by non-linear difference equations is considered. The measurement data have a non-linear relation with the state and are assumed to be available at discrete instants of time. A Bayesian approach to the problem is suggested in which the density function for the state conditioned upon the available measurement data is computed recursively. The evolution of the a posteriori density function cannot be described in a closed form for most systems; the class of linear systems with additive, white gaussian noise provides the major exception. Thus, the problem of non-linear filtering can be viewed as essentially a problem of approximating this density function. For linear systems with additive, white gaussian noise, the a posteriori density is gaussian. The results for linear systems are frequently applied to non-linear systems by introducing linear perturbation theory. Then, the linear equations and gaussian a posteriori density represent approximations to the true description of the system. A generalization of this procedure is described here. The density is approximated by an Edgeworth expansion and the plant and measurerment systems are described, using perturbation techniques, as quadratic equations with additive, white gaussian noise. The Edgeworth expansions are characterized by the central moments of the distribution. Recursion relations are derived for a finite number of these moments and these relations are assumed to describe the set of sufficient statistics for the system. The mean value gives immediately the estimate that minimizes the mean-square error. The well-known linear perturbation theory and this non-linear theory are applied to a simple system and the results are compared.},

Matrix completion has been shown to be an effective technique in state estimation that exploits the low dimensionality of the power system measurements to recover missing information. This technique can utilize an approximate (linear) load flow model, or it can be used with no physical models in a network where no information about the topology or line admittance is available. The direct application of matrix completion algorithms requires solving a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem, which becomes computationally challenging for large networks. We therefore develop a decentralized algorithm that capitalizes on the popular proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (proximal ADMM). The method allows us to distribute the computation among different areas of the network, leading to a scalable algorithm. By doing all computations at individual control areas and only communicating with neighboring areas, the algorithm eliminates the need for data to be sent to a central processing unit and thus increases efficiency and contributes to the goal of autonomous control of distribution networks. We illustrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm numerically using standard IEEE test cases.},

In this paper we first generalize this result by characterizing the (much broader) class of systems for which this property holds. For those systems, the Lie logarithm of the error turns out to obey a linear differential equation. Then, we leverage this “log-linear” property of the error evolution, to prove for those systems the local stability of the IEKF around any trajectory, under the standard conditions of the linear case.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive tracking technique, based on the extended Kalman filter approach, to identify the structural parameters and their changes when vibration data involve damage events. The proposed technique is capable of tracking the changes of system parameters from which the event and severity of structural damage may be detected on-line. Our adaptive filtering technique is based on the current measured data to determine the parametric variation so that the residual error of the estimated parameters is contributed only by noise. This technique is applicable to linear and nonlinear structures. Simulation results for tracking the parametric changes of nonlinear elastic, hysteretic and linear benchmark structures are presented to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed technique in detecting structural damage, using measured vibration data.

As a result, the traditional Kalman filter-based dynamic state estimators may provide strongly biased state estimates. To address these issues, this paper develops a robust generalized maximum-likelihood unscented Kalman filter (GM-UKF). The statistical linearization approach is presented to derive a compact batch-mode regression form by processing the predicted state vector and the received measurements simultaneously. This regression form enhances the data redundancy and allows us to detect bad phasor measurement unit measurements and incorrect state predictions, and filter out unknown Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises through the generalized maximum likelihood-estimator. The latter minimizes a convex Huber function with weights calculated via the projection statistics (PS). Particularly, the PS is applied to a proposed 2-dimensional matrix that consists of temporally correlated innovation vectors and predicted states. Finally, the total influence function is used to derive the error covariance matrix of the GMUKF state estimates, yielding the robust state prediction at the next time instant. Extensive simulations carried out on the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) are devices that convert neural signals into commands to directly control artificial actuators, such as limb prostheses. Previous real-time methods applied to decoding behavioral commands from the activity of populations of neurons have generally relied upon linear models of neural tuning and were limited in the way they used the abundant statistical information contained in the movement profiles of motor tasks. Here, we propose an n-th order unscented Kalman filter which implements two key features: (1) use of a non-linear (quadratic) model of neural tuning which describes neural activity significantly better than commonly-used linear tuning models, and (2) augmentation of the movement state variables with a history of n-1 recent states, which improves prediction of the desired command even before incorporating neural activity information and allows the tuning model to capture relationships between neural activity and movement at multiple time offsets simultaneously. This new filter was tested in BMI experiments in which rhesus monkeys used their cortical activity, recorded through chronically implanted multielectrode arrays, to directly control computer cursors. The 10th order unscented Kalman filter outperformed the standard Kalman filter and the Wiener filter in both off-line reconstruction of movement trajectories and real-time, closed-loop BMI operation.},

	abstract = {Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) systems require the information about system variables, which cannot be directly measured, e.g., the wheel slip or the vehicle side-slip angle. This paper presents a new concept for the vehicle state estimation under assumption that the vehicle is equipped with the standard VDC sensors. It is proposed to utilize an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for estimation purposes, since it is based on a numerically eﬃcient nonlinear stochastic estimation technique. A planar two-track model is combined with the empiric Magic Formula in order to describe the vehicle and tire behavior. Moreover, an advanced vertical tire load calculation method is developed that additionally considers the vertical tire stiﬀness and increases the estimation accuracy. Experimental tests show the good accuracy and robustness of the designed vehicle state estimation concept.},

The state vector includes position, velocity, attitude, and sensor biases and scale factors. Position information from the differential global positioning system (DGPS) solutions is used as measurements. Test results with a micro-electrical-mechanical-systems (MEMS) IMU showed that the alignment converged within 50 s with RMS values of 0.093/spl deg/, 0.094/spl deg/ and 0.388/spl deg/ for roll, pitch and heading, respectively. The UKF works well even in cases of large initial attitude errors (about 30/spl deg/) not only for heading but also for roll and pitch. Therefore, the UKF is a unified approach to handle large and small attitude errors of an inertial navigation system (INS) seamlessly.},

	abstract = {Abstract Data assimilation has traditionally been employed to provide initial conditions for numerical weather prediction (NWP). A multiyear time sequence of objective analyses produced by data assimilation can also be used as an archival record from which to carry out a variety of atmospheric process studies. For this latter propose, NWP analyses are not as accurate as they could be, for each analysis is based only on current and past observed data, and not on any future data. Analyses incorporating future data, as well as current and past data, are termed retrospective analyses. The problem of retrospective objective analysis has not yet received attention in the meteorological literature. In this paper, the fixed-lag Kalman smoother (FLKS) is proposed as a means of providing retrospective analysis capability in data assimilation. The FLKS is a direct generalization of the Kalman filter. It incorporates all data observed up to and including some fixed amount of time past each analysis time. A computationally efficient form of the FLKS is derived. A simple scalar examination of the FLKS demonstrates that incorporating future data improves analyses the most in the presence of dynamical instabilities, for accurate models and for accurate observations. An implementation of the FLKS for a two-dimensional linear shallow-water model corroborates the scalar analysis. The numerical experiments also demonstrate the ability of the FLKS to propagate information upstream as well as downstream, thus improving analysis quality substantially in data voids.},

Also, to enable data association in real-time, we provide efﬁcient algorithms to access the estimation uncertainties of interest based on the factored information matrix.

Similar to a clique tree, a Bayes tree encodes a factored probability density, but unlike the clique tree it is directed and maps more naturally to the square root information matrix of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. In this paper, we highlight three insights provided by our new data structure. First, the Bayes tree provides a better understanding of the matrix factorization in terms of probability densities. Second, we show how the fairly abstract updates to a matrix factorization translate to a simple editing of the Bayes tree and its conditional densities. Third, we apply the Bayes tree to obtain a completely novel algorithm for sparse nonlinear incremental optimization, named iSAM2, which achieves improvements in efﬁciency through incremental variable re-ordering and ﬂuid relinearization, eliminating the need for periodic batch steps. We analyze various properties of iSAM2 in detail, and show on a range of real and simulated datasets that our algorithm compares favorably with other recent mapping algorithms in both quality and efﬁciency.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the question of using a nonlinear complementary filter for attitude estimation of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) given only measurements from a low-cost inertial measurement unit. A nonlinear complementary filter is proposed that combines accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation with integrated gyrometer output for high frequency estimation. The raw accelerometer output includes a component corresponding to airframe acceleration, occurring primarily when the aircraft turns, as well as the gravitational acceleration that is required for the filter. The airframe acceleration is estimated using a simple centripetal force model (based on additional airspeed measurements), augmented by a first order dynamic model for angle-of-attack, and used to obtain estimates of the gravitational direction independent of the airplane manoeuvres. Experimental results are provided on a real-world data set and the performance of the filter is evaluated against the output from a full GPS/INS that was available for the data set.},
